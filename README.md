# EMG-Monitoring
This EMG project involves designing a system with an instrumentation amplifier, filter, rectifier, and notch filter to measure and process muscle electrical activity. The signals are cleaned of noise and artifacts, making the system suitable for biomedical applications such as prosthetics control and neuromuscular monitoring.
